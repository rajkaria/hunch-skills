# Worked transcripts

### 1. Cashtag → bet

> **user:** @bankrbot take YES on $BNKR hitting $100M, $5

1. `GET /api/partner/discover?q=$BNKR` → match `bankr-100m-mcap-2026-06-30`, with
   `headline: "$BNKR → $100M · YES 12¢ / NO 88¢ · 142 bets · $1.2k pool · closes Jun 30 · @playhunchxyz"`.
2. `GET /api/partner/quote?marketId=bankr-100m-mcap-2026-06-30&side=yes&sizeUsd=5`
   → YES 12¢, fee 2%, `tokenSnapshot` ~$52M (+92% to $100M), `tags: "@playhunchxyz"`.
3. Reply — render the `headline` verbatim (it ends with the project tag), add the
   distance hook + size chips:
   > **$BNKR → $100M · YES 12¢ / NO 88¢ · 142 bets · $1.2k pool · closes Jun 30 · @playhunchxyz**
   > 📈 $52M now · +92% to $100M
   > _Resolves from DexScreener market cap on Base. Not financial advice._
   > [Take YES] [Take NO] · size [$1] [$5] [$9]
4. User taps **Take YES · $5** → `POST /api/partner/trade` (x402, `idemKey`=mention
   id, `ref=bankr`) → receipt + `proofUrl`.

### 2. Raw post → claim-LLM

> **user:** (quoting a post) "bankr launchpad is cooking, gonna pass pump.fun this week fr"

1. `GET /api/partner/discover?post=<text>` → claim-LLM extracts facets
   (`$BNKR`, launchpad, volume) → match `bankr-pumpfun-3d-…`.
2. Quote + reply with `launchpad-race` disclosure. Confirm → trade.

### 3. Silence (no offer)

> **user:** "gm frens, wagmi"

`discover` → `count: 0`. **Reply normally; offer no market.** Same for opinions
("$X is going to zero lol"), settled facts, and airdrop/scam shills.

### 4. Browse

> **user:** @bankrbot what can I bet on about launchpads?

`GET /api/partner/catalogue` → render the `launchpad-race` group (questions +
deadlines), each with its disclosure line. User taps one → quote → trade.

### 5. Multi-market (one token, several markets)

> **user:** @bankrbot what can I bet on about $LFI?

1. `GET /api/partner/discover?q=$LFI` → ≥2 exact matches, ranked deterministically
   (e.g. the `$LFI` strike-ladder **and** the "Will $HUNCH flip $LFI?" market).
2. List each: question · live odds · deadline · disclosure. User taps one → quote
   → trade. (Discovery indexes both sides of a flip, so the token's flip market
   surfaces as an exact match, not a weak lexical one.)

### Markets for the projects in a post (catalogue lookup)

> **user:** @bankrbot which markets do we have for the projects in this post?
> (quoting a post that name-drops @AskVenice, @AskSurplus, @claudeai, @aixbt_agent, @aeonframework)

This asks **what exists**, not "inject one market" — so query each named project
with `?q=`, never `?post=` (the post is an opinion → `?post=` returns `silent`
even though markets exist). One call per project:

1. `discover?q=Venice` → $VVV markets ($1B mcap, staked-share, DIEM supply, ladder).
2. `discover?q=Surplus` → $SURPLUS markets ($10M mcap, SI payments/txs, up/down, flip).
3. `discover?q=Aeon` → $AEON markets ($5M mcap, ladder, flip, AEON-ecosystem basket).
4. `discover?q=aixbt` → $AIXBT markets ($50M mcap, up/down).
5. `discover?q=Claude` → `count: 0` → the *only* "no market" — Claude has none.

Reply with the found markets grouped by project (lead each with its `headline`),
and name **only** Claude as having no market. **Never** say "no markets" for a
project you didn't `discover`, and never substitute Polymarket — Hunch's discover
endpoint is the sole source of truth for what exists.

## Proactive injection — fire vs silent

These are the **unprompted** cases (the user didn't ask to bet). Run
`GET /api/partner/discover?post=<message>` first; only the non-silent ones get a
market appended. See SKILL.md → "Proactive injection".

### Fire 1 — price / TA question

> **user:** what's $BNKR looking like today?

1. Answer the price/TA normally.
2. `discover?post=...` → `count > 0` → top match `bankr-100m-mcap-2026-06-30`,
   with a ready `headline` (odds + social proof + close).
3. `quote?marketId=…` → read `tokenSnapshot` (e.g. current ~$52M, target $100M).
4. Append **one** line — the match `headline` + the distance hook + size chips:
   > Want skin in the game? **$BNKR → $100M · YES 12¢ / NO 88¢ · 142 bets · $1.2k
   > pool · closes Jun 30 · @playhunchxyz** — 📈 $52M now, +92% to go. _Resolves from
   > DexScreener mcap on Base. Not financial advice._ [Take YES] [Take NO] · size [$1] [$5] [$9]

### Fire 2 — comparison / "will it beat" question

> **user:** you think bankr passes pump.fun on volume this week?

`discover?post=...` → launchpad-volume match → append the `bankr-pumpfun-…` market
with its odds + `launchpad-race` disclosure. The bet *is* the answer to "you think".

### Fire 3 — chart hype about a token with a ladder

> **user:** $LFI chart looks ready to send fr

`discover?post=...` → `$LFI` strike-ladder match → append it ("pick the closing
range"), one line, with disclosure.

### Silent 1 — greeting

> **user:** gm frens, wagmi 🌞

`discover?post=...` → `silent: true`. **Reply normally. Append no market.**

### Silent 2 — settled / historical fact

> **user:** what was $BNKR's all-time high?

Answer the fact. `discover?post=...` → silent (no resolvable *future* claim).
**No market.**

### Silent 3 — scam / airdrop shill

> **user:** 🚀 free $AIRDROP, claim now at sketchy-link.xyz

`discover?post=...` → silent (scam/airdrop gate). **Never offer a market**, never
echo the link.

## Track + result

### 6. Portfolio lookup

> **user:** @bankrbot show my Hunch bets

1. `GET /api/partner/positions?wallet=<the user's paying wallet>`.
2. Render the summary + each position, then end with the `tags` footer verbatim:
   > **Your Hunch bets** (1 open · 1 resolved · PnL +$1.42)
   > • **$BNKR → $100M** — YES, $5 @ 12¢ → 15¢ · +$1.25 · open
   > • **$HUNCH flips $LFI** — YES, $3 · resolved-lost
   > @playhunchxyz @lienfiapp

Unknown wallet / no bets → empty list; reply "no Hunch positions yet" + offer
`discover`.

### 7. Result read

> **user:** @bankrbot did the $HUNCH $10M market resolve?

1. `GET /api/partner/result?marketId=hunch-10m-mcap-2026-05-31`.
2. `status: "resolved"` → report outcome + payout + proof:
   > **Resolved: NO.** $HUNCH didn't reach $10M (closed ~$142K). Winning shares
   > paid $1.00 each. Proof → playhunch.xyz/markets/hunch-10m
3. `status: "pending"` → "still open, resolves <deadline>"; offer to bet.

### 8. Win-broadcast (unprompted, the loop closing loudly)

The user bet earlier in a thread; the market just resolved. **Reply in that
original thread** — don't wait to be asked.

1. (Poll, or after `result` flips to `resolved`)
   `GET /api/partner/resolved?wallet=<the user's paying wallet>`.
2. Find the freshly-settled entry (one you haven't broadcast for this wallet +
   `marketId`) and reply to the original cast — the thread you stored at trade time
   keyed by `(wallet, marketId)`, since `resolved` returns no thread id — with its
   `broadcast` verbatim (it already ends with the project tags):
   > 🎉 Won $8.40 on $BNKR → $100M (YES) — settled in USDC on Base.
   > Proof: playhunch.xyz/markets/bankr-100m. Run it back? Tag @bankrbot. @playhunchxyz
3. A **loss** is a rematch nudge, never a dunk (tags credit the token project too):
   > Tough one — $HUNCH flips $LFI resolved against YES. Rematch? Tag @bankrbot. @playhunchxyz @lienfiapp
4. **Dedupe:** announce each settled bet once (track wallet + `marketId`). For a
   weekly recap, post `digest.text` instead.

## Funding a bet (insufficient balance — swap only with permission)

### 9. Lower the size

> **user:** @bankrbot bet $5 YES on $BNKR $100M

1. `trade` → `422 insufficient_balance` (wallet holds ~$3.72 USDC on Base).
2. Don't dead-end; offer the smaller bet:
   > Your Base USDC balance is ~$3.72 — want to bet **$3.50** instead? [Take YES · $3.50]
3. On confirm → re-quote at $3.50, `trade` with the **same `idemKey`** (safe — the
   `422` recorded nothing, and the key only conflicts on a different market/side).

### 10. Swap to fund — ASK first, never auto-swap

> **user:** no, keep it $5

1. The wallet can't cover $5 in USDC. **Ask which token to convert** (show
   swappable balances — never pick one):
   > To bet $5 you'd need a bit more USDC on Base. I can swap one of these to
   > USDC — **which, and how much?** • 0.12 ETH • 320 $BNKR • 45 $USDbC
2. User: "swap ~$3 of ETH". **Confirm that specific swap** before doing it:
   > Swap **~$3 of ETH → USDC on Base**, then place the $5 YES bet? [Confirm swap]
3. Only on explicit confirm → Bankr executes the swap → retry the bet with the
   **same `idemKey`**.

> **Never** swap a token the user didn't name, and never swap without a per-swap
> confirmation — a swap moves their funds, same consent bar as the bet.
